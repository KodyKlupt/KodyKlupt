### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am a PhD student studying Biochemistry at Queen's University, Canada. My interests are structural biology, protein modeling, and synthetic biology. 

### Formerly, I was involved in iGEM on my universities team, and enjoy using/editing open source libraries that make my time in the lab a little easier!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... a synthetic biology course for our undergraduate program, liquid chromatography result automation, and other small programs...apart from my lab work
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Python (apart from learning biochemistry and structural biology...), Molecular Operating Environment, and CCP4 program suite
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... generative AI and machine learning to predict the biophysical properties of proteins
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... kody.klupt@queensu.ca
